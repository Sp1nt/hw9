                            William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 â€“ 23 April 1616) was an English poet,
                            playwright and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and
                            the world's greatest dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard
                            of Avon". His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately 39 plays,
                            154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain
                            authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are
                            performed more often than those of any other playwright.

                            Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18,
                            he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and
                            Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an
                            actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men,
                            later known as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to
                            Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life
                            survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical
                            appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to
                            him were written by others. Such theories are often criticised for failing to adequately
                            note that few records survive of most commoners of the period.

                            Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were
                            primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best work produced in
                            these genres. Until about 1608, he wrote mainly tragedies, among them Hamlet, Othello,
                            King Lear, and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest works in the English
                            language. In the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances)
                            and collaborated with other playwrights.

                            Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy
                            in his lifetime. However, in 1623, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare's, John
                            Heminges and Henry Condell, published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a
                            posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works that included all but two
                            of his plays. The volume was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in which Jonson
                            presciently hails Shakespeare in a now-famous quote as "not of an age, but for all
                            time".

                            Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, Shakespeare's works have been continually
                            adapted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance. His plays
                            remain popular and are studied, performed, and reinterpreted through various cultural
                            and political contexts around the world.
